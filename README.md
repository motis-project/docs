Documentation was originally setup following this tutorial:
[Clear, Functional C++ Documentation with Sphinx + Breathe + Doxygen + CMake](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clear-functional-c-documentation-with-sphinx-breathe-doxygen-cmake/)

The documentation is then published to GitHub Pages: <https://motis-project.github.io/utl/>

[breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io) is used to insert Doxygen doc snippets
into the Sphinx-generated documentation.

List of supported directives: <https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/directives.html#directives>.
They have to be inserted using [`myst-parser` directive syntax for Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/roles-and-directives.html).

## Installing the necessary tools

    apt install doxygen
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Generating the documentation
This script will invoke `doxygen` & `sphinx`.
It is design to be called from a [sub-pkg](https://github.com/motis-project/pkg)
fetched in `deps/docs/`:

    deps/docs/build_docs.sh

## Using Sphinx auto-reload
Once `docs/conf.py` has been generated by `build_docs.sh`:

    sphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html --open-browser
